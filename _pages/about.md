I'm a Master of Science (MSc) student at Western University in Geophysics. My research is focused on the ground motions felt in the Greater Vancouver area caused by large earthquakes around the Cascadia subduction zone. To study these hazards, I run large scale numerical simulations of the anelastic wave equation using a finite difference scheme on parallel computers. These ground motions are used to estimate the shaking felt by these earthquakes.

I'm also using a convolutional neural network with an encoder/decoder structure similar to those seen in semantic image segmentation problems to create velocity models of the subsurface from dispersion curves. This will eliminate the need to manually analyze the curves and run an inversion.
Other research interests include: data science and machine learning, planetary science, the geodynamo and magnetohydrodynamics, heat flow in the Earth and Lunar core, volcanic hazards and volcanology, glaciology and geodynamics.
