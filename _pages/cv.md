Education
======
* B.Sc. in Geophysics, Western University, 2020
* M.Sc. in Geophysics, Western University, 2022 


Work experience
======
* 2020 - Present: Computational Seismology Research Assistant
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments included:  Running large finite difference numerical simulations on the supercomputer SHARCNET that simulate the anelastic wave equation and earthquake ground motions. I am also creating a multi-task semantic image segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) to create a velocity model of the subsurface from dispersion curve images. This could eventually replace geophysical inversion. Other accomplishments include conducting K-means clustering analysis of historical earthquakes located offshore Vancouver, conducted data wrangling and cleaning to convert data into the proper format, producing documentation of the earthquake simulation code used, and running numerical simulations to determine ground motions from large, deep earthquakes.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Molnar, Dr. Ghofrani

* 2020 - Present: Teaching Assistant
  * Western University
  * Duties included: Designing and leading lab sessions teaching students about geophysical surveys and geophysical data processing. This included providing students with tutorials in MS Excel and MATLAB during lab sessions and office hours so that they could use these skills to process and interpret geophysical data. Other responsibilities include correspondence with the students, writing midterm and final exam questions, and marking.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Secco, Dr. Blamey

* Sept 2019 - May 2020: High Pressure-High Temperature Physics Researcher â€“ Thesis project	
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments included: Designing using Autocad, then machining an innovative cubic cell for high pressure, high temperature experiments. This design will be used for future high pressure and temperature experiments using multi-anvil and cubic-anvil presses. Measured thermal conductivity of an Iron-Nickel alloy and calculated heat flow in the lunar interior.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Secco

* Oct 2017 - April 2018: Geophysics Undergraduate Researcher
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments included: Contributed to the development of a geodatabase of geophysical data for the Vancouver project. I extracted data from old geophysical and geotechnical surveys and created csv files of this data, having to read and interpret the results. The data was then uploaded to the geodatabase. This data was used to create 3D models of the subsurface.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Molnar
