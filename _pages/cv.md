Work experience
======
* 2020 - Present: Computational Seismology Research Assistant
  * Western University
  * As a research fellow for Dr. Sheri Molnar’s research group, I run large finite difference numerical simulations on the SHARCNET supercomputer consortium that simulate the anelastic wave equation and earthquake ground motions. The synthetic time series data are then compared to empirical data and other simulations to estimate the effects of topography, attenuation, source depth, mechanism and location of the earthquake.
I am also creating a semantic image segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) to create velocity models of the subsurface from dispersion curves. This could eventually replace the need for dispersion curve picking, reducing bias in shear wave velocity models and eliminating geophysical inversion from this task.
Duties and Accomplishments Include:
    * Conducted K-means clustering analysis of historical earthquakes located offshore Vancouver.
    * Conducted data wrangling and cleaning to convert data into the proper format.
    * Produced documentation of the earthquake simulation code used.
    * Ran numerical simulations to determine ground motions from large, deep earthquakes.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Molnar, Dr. Ghofrani

* 2020 - Present: Teaching Assistant
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments Included: Designing and leading lab sessions teaching students about geophysical surveys and geophysical data processing. This included providing students with tutorials in MS Excel and MATLAB during lab sessions and office hours so that they could use these skills to process and interpret geophysical data. Other responsibilities include correspondence with the students, writing midterm and final exam questions, and marking.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Secco, Dr. Blamey
  
* 2014- Present: Sales Associate
  * FGL Sports Ltd.
  * Duties Include: Providing service and advice to customers looking to purchase camping equipment, outdoor equipment, footwear and outerwear through knowledge I have acquired from personal endeavors in the outdoors and relevant training in the product technology. 

* Sept 2019 - May 2020: High Pressure-High Temperature Physics Researcher – Thesis project	
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments Included: Designing using Autocad, then machining an innovative cubic cell for high pressure, high temperature experiments. This design will be used for future high pressure and temperature experiments using multi-anvil and cubic-anvil presses. Measured thermal conductivity of an Iron-Nickel alloy and calculated heat flow in the lunar interior.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Secco

* Oct 2017 - April 2018: Geophysics Undergraduate Researcher
  * Western University
  * Duties and Accomplishments Included: Contributed to the development of a geodatabase of geophysical data for the Vancouver project. I extracted data from old geophysical and geotechnical surveys and created csv files of this data, having to read and interpret the results. The data was then uploaded to the SQL geodatabase using SQLite. This data was used to create 3D models of the subsurface.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Molnar
