This GitHub repository is the clustering algorithms i have completed for research, interest, and coursework, including:

1) Clustering of Casacadia subduction zone earthquakes, then solely cascadia subduction zone earthquakes directly offshore Vancouver. This is used to classify earthquake rupture mechanism based on epicenter location.

2) A workbook to classify mall shoppers based on their spending. K-means clustering was done to sort the different shoppers into clusters based off their spending. The Elbow method was used to determine the correct amount of clusters needed.

3) A workbook to cluster customers at a comic book store based on their recency, monetary value, cost of service, and frequency. These customers were clustered into 5 groups based on this data, with specific recommendations to increase value of these interactions for each of these 5 types of customers.
